Next.js Overview
What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React-based, open-source, full-stack framework used to build fast, production-ready web applications.

It is developed and maintained by Vercel.

Why Next.js?

Supports multiple rendering strategies

Improves SEO and performance

Provides built-in optimizations

Reduces configuration and boilerplate

Rendering Types in Next.js (Hybrid Rendering)

Next.js supports hybrid rendering, meaning you can mix different rendering methods in one app:

SSR (Server-Side Rendering) – Pages are rendered on the server for better SEO and fast first load

SSG (Static Site Generation) – Pages are generated at build time

ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) – Static pages update without rebuilding the entire app

CSR (Client-Side Rendering) – UI updates on the browser after page load

Key Features
1. File-Based Routing

Routes are created automatically based on the folder and file structure

No need for extra routing libraries

2. Image Optimization

Automatic image resizing and optimization

Lazy loading by default

Supports modern formats like WebP

3. API Routes

Backend APIs can be created inside the Next.js app

No need for a separate backend for simple APIs

4. Rendering Support

SSR for SEO-friendly dynamic pages

SSG for static content

ISR for updating static pages

CSR for interactive UI components

5. Styling Support

Global CSS

CSS Modules

Sass / SCSS support

6. TypeScript Support

Built-in TypeScript configuration

No extra setup required

7. Middleware

Runs before rendering

Useful for authentication, redirects, and logging

8. Edge & Serverless Deployment

Optimized for serverless and edge functions

Fast, scalable, and globally distributed
